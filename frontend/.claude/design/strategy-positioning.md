## Design Strategy & Positioning

### Blend Positioning: The DineLocal Advantage

**Core Insight:**
DineLocal exists at the intersection of 3 established categories:

```
Airbnb Experiences (Trust & Discovery)
    ∩
DineLocal = OpenTable/Resy (Booking & Reliability)
    ∩
Meetup/Eventbrite (Community & Connection)
```

---

### What We Take From Each

#### From Airbnb Experiences

- ✅ **DO:** Trust-building host profiles with verification
- ✅ **DO:** Photo-first discovery and visual storytelling
- ✅ **DO:** Review system with host response
- ❌ **DON'T:** Complex search with 50+ filters (too overwhelming)
- ❌ **DON'T:** "Experiences" branding (too generic for dining)

#### From OpenTable/Resy

- ✅ **DO:** Instant booking confirmation (no waiting)
- ✅ **DO:** Time slot selection with availability
- ✅ **DO:** Dietary restriction handling (safety-critical)
- ❌ **DON'T:** Restaurant-centric design (we're home-centric)
- ❌ **DON'T:** Corporate tone (we're warm and personal)

#### From Meetup/Eventbrite

- ✅ **DO:** Community-feel design with host bios
- ✅ **DO:** Event details (what to expect, what's included)
- ✅ **DO:** Guest capacity and social dynamics
- ❌ **DON'T:** Event-focused language (we're experience-focused)
- ❌ **DON'T:** Lack of payment infrastructure (we need secure payments)

### Visual Differentiation Strategy

**How DineLocal Stands Out:**

| Element            | Airbnb            | OpenTable         | **DineLocal**                  |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Hero Image**     | Activity shots    | Food + restaurant | **Food + host in home**        |
| **Primary Action** | "Request to Book" | "Reserve"         | **"Book Experience"**          |
| **Trust Signals**  | Superhost badge   | Michelin stars    | **Verification + home safety** |
| **Tone**           | Adventurous       | Professional      | **Warm & welcoming**           |
| **Color Palette**  | Warm coral        | Dark elegant      | **Vibrant but authentic**      |

**WHY THIS MATTERS:**
Users need to immediately understand: "This is dining in someone's home" (not restaurant, not activity).
