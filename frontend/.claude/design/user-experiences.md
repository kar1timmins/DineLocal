## Guest Experience Patterns

**Goal:** Make discovery, booking, and attending experiences delightful.

### Discovery Flow (Search & Browse)

**✅ DO:**

- **Photo-first cards** (food is hero)
- **Clear cuisine tags** (Italian, Thai, Vegan)
- **Prominent ratings** (⭐ 4.9)
- **Price per person** (not total)
- **Quick filters** (cuisine, date, price, dietary)

**❌ DON'T:**

- Text-heavy cards
- Hidden cuisine type
- Overall rating only (no count)
- Total price without per-person breakdown
- Complex filter UI

**WHY:**

- Users scan visually first (images process 60,000x faster than text)
- Cuisine tags enable quick filtering
- Review count builds trust (24 reviews > "Highly rated")
