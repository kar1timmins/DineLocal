## Nielsen Norman Heuristics

**10 Usability Heuristics for DineLocal** (Jakob Nielsen, 1994 - still relevant)

### 1. Visibility of System Status

**Principle:** Keep users informed about what's happening through appropriate feedback within a reasonable time.

**DineLocal Application:**

- Show booking progress (Step 2 of 4)
- Display loading states (skeletons, spinners)
- Indicate form field validation (checkmark for valid)
- Show message delivery status (sent, delivered, read)

---

### 2. Match Between System and Real World

**Principle:** Speak the users' language with words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user.

**DineLocal Application:**

- "Experience" not "listing" (more personal)
- "Host" not "vendor" (warmer)
- "Book" not "reserve" or "purchase" (familiar from Airbnb)
- Use cuisine names people know (Italian, Thai vs obscure regional names)

---

### 3. User Control and Freedom

**Principle:** Users often perform actions by mistake. Provide a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave unwanted states.

**DineLocal Application:**

- Cancel booking (with clear policy)
- Edit experience listing
- Delete draft
- Undo photo upload
- Go back in booking wizard

---

### 4. Consistency and Standards

**Principle:** Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing.

**DineLocal Application:**

- "Book" always means same action
- Star rating always means host/experience rating
- Heart icon always means favorite/wishlist
- Use same patterns as Airbnb/OpenTable (Jakob's Law)

---

### 5. Error Prevention

**Principle:** Prevent problems from occurring in the first place.

**DineLocal Application:**

- Show available dates (prevent booking unavailable dates)
- Validate dietary restrictions before booking
- Confirm host can accommodate before finalizing
- Prevent double-booking for hosts

---

### 6. Recognition Rather Than Recall

**Principle:** Minimize user's memory load by making elements, actions, and options visible.

**DineLocal Application:**

- Show recent searches
- Display booking details in confirmation email
- Pre-fill forms with previous info
- Show availability calendar (don't make users remember dates)

---

### 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use

**Principle:** Shortcuts accelerate interaction for expert users.

**DineLocal Application:**

- "Book Again" for repeat guests
- Quick filters for frequent searches
- Bulk actions for hosts (update multiple experiences)
- Keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+K for search)

---

### 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

**Principle:** Interfaces should not contain irrelevant or rarely needed information.

**DineLocal Application:**

- Experience card: Only 5 key pieces of info
- Progressive disclosure (show details on demand)
- Clean, uncluttered layouts
- Focus on food photos and host story

---

### 9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors

**Principle:** Error messages should be expressed in plain language, precisely indicate the problem, and suggest a solution.

**DineLocal Application:**

- "Email address is invalid" not "Error 422"
- "Host cannot accommodate nut allergies. Choose another experience or contact host."
- "Booking failed. Please try again or contact support."

---

### 10. Help and Documentation

**Principle:** Provide documentation to help users understand how to complete tasks.

**DineLocal Application:**

- FAQ for common questions
- Tooltips for complex features
- Video guide for experience creation
- 24/7 customer support
