## Trust & Safety Design

**Purpose:** Build confidence in a P2P marketplace where strangers meet in homes.

---

### The Trust Equation

**P2P Marketplace Trust = Credibility + Reliability + Intimacy - Self-Interest**

**Credibility:**

- Host verification
- Identity confirmation
- Background checks (where legal)

**Reliability:**

- Consistent communication
- Accurate listings
- On-time experiences

**Intimacy:**

- Personal host stories
- Authentic photos
- Real reviews

**Self-Interest (Minimize):**

- Transparent pricing
- Clear cancellation policies
- No hidden fees

---

### Trust-Building: Do's and Don'ts

#### Host Verification

**✅ DO:**

- Display verification badge prominently (top of profile)
- Explain verification process ("ID verified, phone confirmed, home reviewed")
- Show verification date ("Verified June 2025")
- Use trust colors (blue for verified, gold for superhost)
- Make badge clickable for more info

**❌ DON'T:**

- Hide verification in tooltip
- Unclear verification criteria
- No explanation of what "verified" means
- Use verification badge for unverified hosts (damages credibility)

**WHY:**

- 89% of users check verification before booking (Trust Research 2024)
- Verified hosts get 3.5x more bookings
- Verification badge increases perceived safety by 65%

**VISUAL EXAMPLE:**

**Good:**

```

**Bad:**

└─────────────────────────────────┘

#### Reviews & Ratings

**✅ DO:**

- Show rating prominently (star rating + number)
- Display review count (social proof)
- Show recent reviews first
- Include host responses (builds trust)
- Allow filtering by rating
- Show reviewer verification status
- Display review date ("June 2025")

**❌ DON'T:**

- Hide reviews below fold
- Only show positive reviews (cherry-picking damages trust)
- Allow fake reviews
- No host response option
- Ambiguous dates ("a few months ago")

**WHY:**

- 97% of users read reviews before booking (BrightLocal 2024)
- Host response rate correlates with +40% booking rate
- Recent reviews (< 3 months) are 2x more influential

**REVIEW DISPLAY (Good):**

- Display instant confirmation message
- Provide booking reference number immediately

- Display cancellation policy before booking

**❌ DON'T:**

- "Request to book" without instant confirmation (creates anxiety)
- No booking reference
- Delayed confirmation email (> 5 minutes = user worried)
- Hide cancellation policy
- Unclear next steps

**WHY:**

- Instant booking increases conversion by 28% vs "request to book"
- Immediate confirmation reduces support tickets by 45%
