## Content & Copywriting

### Tone of Voice

**DineLocal speaks like:**

- 🗣️ A friendly local guide (not a corporate robot)
- 🎯 Clear and direct (not vague or wordy)
- 🌟 Encouraging and helpful (not pushy or salesy)
- 🌍 Culturally aware (not assuming or insensitive)

### Copywriting Principles

**1. Be Clear and Concise**

```
✅ CORRECT:
"Book your table in 60 seconds"
"3 spots left for tonight"
"Italian • $$ • Open Now"

❌ INCORRECT:
"Utilize our streamlined reservation system to secure your dining experience"
"Limited availability remaining for this evening's service"
"Italian Cuisine • Moderately Priced • Currently Accepting Reservations"
```

**2. Use Action-Oriented Language**

```
✅ CORRECT:
- "Book Now" (not "Make a Reservation")
- "Find Restaurants" (not "Search")
- "View Menu" (not "See Menu Items")
- "Confirm Booking" (not "Submit")

❌ INCORRECT:
- "Proceed to Reservation"
- "Browse Options"
- "Access Menu"
- "Finalize"
```

**3. Build Trust with Specificity**

```
✅ CORRECT:
"Hosted by Chef Maria, 15 years experience"
"4.8★ from 127 verified guests"
"Free cancellation until 6pm today"
"Instant confirmation"

❌ INCORRECT:
"Experienced host"
"Highly rated"
"Flexible cancellation"
"Quick confirmation"
```

**4. Address Tourist Needs**

```
✅ CORRECT:
"English menu available"
"Vegetarian options: 8 dishes"
"Near Central Station (5 min walk)"
"Credit cards accepted"

❌ INCORRECT:
"Menu available"
"Dietary options"
"Centrally located"
"Payment accepted"
```

### Microcopy Examples

**Empty States:**

```
✅ "No bookings yet. Discover restaurants near you!"
✅ "Your favorites list is empty. Start exploring!"

❌ "No results found."
❌ "0 items"
```

**Loading States:**

```
✅ "Finding the perfect restaurants for you..."
✅ "Confirming your booking..."

❌ "Loading..."
❌ "Please wait"
```

**Error States:**

```
✅ "Oops! This restaurant is fully booked. Try these alternatives:"
✅ "We couldn't process your payment. Please check your card details."

❌ "Error 404"
❌ "Payment failed"
```

**Success States:**

```
✅ "Booking confirmed! Check your email for details."
✅ "Added to favorites ❤️"

❌ "Success"
❌ "Operation completed"
```

### Content Guidelines

**DO:**

- ✅ Use sentence case for headings ("Discover local dining")
- ✅ Write in second person ("You'll love this...")
- ✅ Include specific details (times, numbers, locations)
- ✅ Use contractions ("you'll", "we're") for warmth
- ✅ Address accessibility needs explicitly
- ✅ Provide context for tourists (currency, local customs)

**DON'T:**

- ❌ Use jargon or technical terms
- ❌ Write in third person ("Users can...")
- ❌ Be vague ("Various options available")
- ❌ Use formal language ("Please be advised...")
- ❌ Assume local knowledge
- ❌ Use marketing fluff ("Amazing!", "Incredible!")
