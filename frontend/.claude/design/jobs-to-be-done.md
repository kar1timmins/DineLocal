## Jobs-to-be-Done Framework

### Overview

**What is JTBD?**
Focus on the outcome users want, not the features they request.

**Clayton Christensen Example:**

> "People don't want a 1/4 inch drill, they want a 1/4 inch hole."

**DineLocal Translation:**

> "Guests don't want a booking system, they want cultural connection through food."

### JTBD-Driven Design Process

**When designing a new feature:**

1. **Identify the job:** What outcome does the user want?
2. **Map the journey:** What are the functional, emotional, and social dimensions?
3. **Find friction points:** Where does the current design fail the job?
4. **Design for the job:** Create UI that helps users "hire" DineLocal for their job

**Example: Booking Flow**
